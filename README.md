# Welcome to Paul Flanagan's McDonald's analysis! This program tabulates and displays a given dataset (mcdonalds.csv),
# takes in a converted JSON file (mcdonalds.json) to display all locations on a map, centered at the center of the United States, 
# as the dataset is exclusive to McDonalds chains. From there, it takes five state inputs from the user and compares the number
# of chains that the state has, then tabulates and maps all locations of the first state entered. Then, it shifts to a more macro
# analysis of grouping locations by state and counting the number of locations in each state, then displaying the data in table
# and chart form to demonstrate the distribution of McDonald's locations by state. Then, using the same Pandas groupby function,
# it counts the four states most populated with chains and maps a connective hypothetical "road trip" between the four cities,
# as ordered by the user.
